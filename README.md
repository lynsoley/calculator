# Calculator Project

## Purpose
This calculator project was developed as a beginner's project to learn Python programming. It serves as an introductory project for individuals who are new to Python and programming in general. By building a simple calculator application, beginners can get hands-on experience with basic Python syntax, user input, and GUI (Graphical User Interface) development using the Tkinter library.

## Technical Description
The calculator application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface. The structure of the project is as follows:
- **Main Script**: `calculator.py` contains the main logic of the calculator application, including functions for arithmetic operations and event handling.
- **GUI Layout**: The graphical layout of the calculator is defined using Tkinter widgets such as Entry for display and Button for input.
- **Styling**: Colors and fonts are applied to the GUI elements using Tkinter's styling options.

## Color Theme
The color theme of the calculator application is designed to provide a visually appealing interface while maintaining readability and usability. The color scheme includes shades of blue and green for the buttons, with contrasting text colors for improved visibility.
